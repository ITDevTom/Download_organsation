# Download Folder Organsation
Archive files and folders after a set amount of days and then delete once a set time has passed.

Are you like me and either through work or personal life seem to download a huge amount of items?

With this little tool I need not worry about my downloads taking up too much space. After 7 days since the last time a file was updated this will move it into its archive folder and then after 30 it will remove it entiirely.
